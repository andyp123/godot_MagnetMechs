MAGNET MECHS
磁力騎士 (jiryoku kishi)

Sizes:
- Minimum crouch height: 3m
- Maximum step height: 2.5 - 3m (ideal 2m?)
- Minimum width (tunnel): 4m
- Minimum width (walkway): 5m (could adjust movement for this)
- Max slope angle: 60 degrees
- Cargo height: 1m per unit of weight (weight_units to avoid collision with PhysicsBody weight)

Street/Tile size: 8x8m? 10x10m?
Road should be about 4-5m across not including footpath
LZ should be at least 5m in diameter

Level goals:
Using the magnet mech, the player must manipulate objects in the environment to get life pods
safely to the rescue zone, where they will be saved by manned drone.

Cargo:
- Life Pod (1): Place of refuge for people in an emergency. Must be taken to LZ for pickup
- Reinforced Steel Block (2): Can't be pushed around or destroyed, but can be lifted
- Abandoned Vehicle (1): Can be pushed to a degree, but better to blow them up
- Cannon (3): Large gun that can be used to unblock areas of debris or shoot enemies

Level gimmicks:
Weight switch: Place cargo on the switch and it will activate
Door: Switches can open doors.
Rescue Zone: The player must place rescue pods here to complete the level

Rescue Pods:
Life pods only have a certain amount of emergency power before they can no longer cycle clean air
and the inhabitants inside suffocate. Life pods can use the player mech as a power source
while they are being carried, so their own power source will not drain.
