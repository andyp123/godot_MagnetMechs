Magnet Mechs Tweaks:
- Fullscreen/window support
- Better controller support. Everything should work on gamepad
- Would be nice to auto-detect gamepad/mouse keyboard
  - gamepad input switches to gamepad
  - mouse button or key switches to keyboard/mouse
- Menu scaling and correct positioning regardless of screen size

Stretch:
- Is it trivial to display button glyphs in text boxes in Godot?
  - can they be switched in dynamically?
- Localisation support (just to learn how in Godot)
